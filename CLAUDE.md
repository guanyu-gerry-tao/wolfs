# CLAUDE.md — wolf

## What is wolf

**W**orkflow of **O**utreaching, **L**inkedIn & **F**illing

AI-powered job hunting CLI + MCP server. Finds roles, tailors resumes, fills forms, and sends outreach emails. Can be invoked by other agents (e.g. OpenClaw).

## Current milestone

**Milestone 1 — Scaffolding & Skeleton** (in progress)

Goal: wolf is runnable as both a CLI and an MCP server, all subcommands registered (stubs ok).

See [docs/MILESTONES.md](docs/MILESTONES.md) for full milestone plan.

## Workflow rules

- Do NOT commit or push without explicit user approval. Always show changes and wait for confirmation first.

## Documentation rules

- All markdown documents (except `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`) MUST have a Chinese version with `_zh` suffix (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `ARCHITECTURE_zh.md`)
- When creating or updating an English doc, always create or update the corresponding `_zh` version in the same commit
- Chinese versions must stay in sync with their English counterparts

## Common commands

```bash
npm run build       # compile TypeScript
npm run dev         # run in watch mode
npm run test        # run tests
wolf --help         # CLI help
wolf mcp serve      # start MCP server
```
